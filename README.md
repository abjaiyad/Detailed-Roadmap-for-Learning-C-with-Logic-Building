# Roadmap for Learning C Programming with Logic Building

```plaintext
This roadmap provides a step-by-step guide for mastering C programming, 
focusing on building strong logic and problem-solving skills.

Phase 1: Basics of C Programming
1. Set up your C development environment (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio Code).
2. Understand the structure of a C program.
3. Learn input/output functions (`printf` and `scanf`).
4. Study basic data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
5. Write simple programs like calculating area or displaying patterns.

Example: Hello World Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
